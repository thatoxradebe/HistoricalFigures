# HistoricalFigures

Hello! This is an application I made called Historical Figures.

This app generates the names and infromation of important people throughout history.
The app was made for students who are studying history, to assist them in getting to know more about famous individuals who have contributed to society in a more interractive way.

I made the app in Android Studio so it is all written in kotlin. The app is very simple to use, it features 2 buttons, 1 edit text field and 1 text view field.
To use the app, the user types in an age from 20-100 years old in attempt to get an age when a historical figure passed away. 
The user then clicks on the "Generate" button and the text view field will output information about a certain historical figure along with some information about them and the age that they passed away. If there is no person recorded for that specific age that the user input, the output text will read "There is no famous figure who passed away at that age, please try again." The user can then click on the "Clear" button which will reset the app and they will have the chance to input a different age.
If the user were to type in an age that is out of range, the text view output will read, "Invalid input, please enter an age between 20-100. Then again, the user can click on the "Clear" button to start again. 

This is essentially the purpose of the app.
